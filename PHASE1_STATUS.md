# Phase 1 Implementation Status

**Branch**: `taj/conversation-context`
**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETE** - Ready for Testing
**Date**: 2025-01-18

---

## Summary

Phase 1 implementation is **complete**. All code has been written and committed. The implementation adds conversation memory (with plaintext checkpoints) and dual context system (room context + conversation history) without encryption.

---

## What Was Implemented

### âœ… Rust Bot (verji-vagent-bot)

1. **RoomMessage Type** (`redis_client.rs`)
   - Fields: sender, content, timestamp, is_bot
   - Serializable for Redis transport

2. **GraphRequest Update** (`redis_client.rs`)
   - Added session_id field
   - Added room_context field (Vec<RoomMessage>)
   - Updated query_with_streaming() signature

3. **Session ID Builder** (`verji_agent.rs`)
   - Format: `{room_id}:{thread_id}:{user_id}`
   - Default thread_id is "main"

4. **Room Context Fetching Stub** (`verji_agent.rs`)
   - fetch_room_context() returns empty vec
   - TODO: Implement matrix-sdk 0.14 API
   - Non-fatal fallback

5. **Updated Responder** (`verji_agent.rs`)
   - Builds session_id before sending to graph
   - Fetches room context (currently empty)
   - Passes both to graph via Redis

### âœ… Python Graph (verji-vagent-graph)

1. **Type Definitions** (`types.py` - NEW)
   - RoomMessage dataclass
   - RequestMetadata dataclass
   - GraphRequest dataclass with from_dict()

2. **Checkpointer Integration** (`main.py`)
   - AsyncRedisSaver initialization (PLAINTEXT)
   - Separate Redis client for checkpoints
   - Pass checkpointer to VerjiAgent

3. **Dual Context System** (`graph.py`)
   - AgentState with session_id and room_context fields
   - room_context is ephemeral (no annotation)
   - messages use add_messages (persisted)
   - _format_room_context() converts RoomMessage to text
   - _respond_node() builds LLM input:
     * SystemMessage (room context)
     * Conversation history (checkpoint)

4. **process() Method** (`graph.py`)
   - Accepts session_id, query, room_context
   - Uses session_id as thread_id for checkpoint
   - LangGraph auto-merges with checkpoint

### âœ… Configuration

1. **Environment Variables** (`.env`, `.env.example`)
   - ROOM_CONTEXT_LIMIT=20
   - CHECKPOINT_TTL=86400

## Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **Room context stubbed** | Get checkpoint flow working first, implement Matrix API later |
| **Plaintext checkpoints** | Phase 2 will add encryption - same API |
| **room_context ephemeral** | No annotation â†’ not persisted â†’ regenerated each query |
| **SystemMessage for room context** | Prepended to LLM input, NOT added to state["messages"] |
| **session_id as thread_id** | LangGraph checkpoint isolation per (room, user) |

---

## What's Different from Original POC

| Aspect | Before (POC) | After (Phase 1) |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Memory** | None | 24h checkpoint memory |
| **Context** | Single query | Room context + conversation history |
| **State** | Stateless | LangGraph checkpoint persistence |
| **Messages** | [HumanMessage] | [HumanMessage, AIMessage, ...] accumulate |
| **Session** | No concept | session_id = room:thread:user |

---

## Testing Plan

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Ensure Tilt is running
tilt up

# Wait for all services to be green in Tilt UI
# http://localhost:10350
```

### Test 1: Checkpoint Creation

**Goal**: Verify checkpoints are created in Redis

```bash
# In Matrix room:
User: "@vagent hello"
Bot: "Hi! How can I help?"

# Check Redis:
redis-cli
> KEYS checkpoint:*
# Should see: checkpoint:!room:main:@user:...

> GET checkpoint:!room:main:@user:latest
# Should see JSON with messages (plaintext)
```

**Expected**:
- âœ… Checkpoint key exists
- âœ… Contains messages array
- âœ… Plaintext (readable JSON)

### Test 2: Conversation Memory

**Goal**: Bot remembers previous conversation

```bash
# In Matrix room:
User: "@vagent my name is Alice"
Bot: "Nice to meet you, Alice!"

# Wait 5 seconds

User: "@vagent what's my name?"
Bot: "Your name is Alice" (or similar)
```

**Expected**:
- âœ… Bot remembers "Alice" from previous message
- âœ… Checkpoint updated with both messages

### Test 3: Session Isolation

**Goal**: Different users have separate checkpoints

```bash
# User A in room:
Alice: "@vagent my favorite color is blue"
Bot: "Got it!"

# User B in same room:
Bob: "@vagent what's Alice's favorite color?"
Bot: "I don't know" (Bob's checkpoint is separate)
```

**Expected**:
- âœ… Two different checkpoint keys in Redis
- âœ… Bob's checkpoint doesn't contain Alice's messages

### Test 4: Checkpoint Persistence

**Goal**: Conversation survives bot restart

```bash
# In Matrix room:
User: "@vagent remember I like pizza"
Bot: "Noted!"

# Restart bot (Tilt UI: click restart button or kubectl delete pod)

# After restart:
User: "@vagent what do I like?"
Bot: "You like pizza"
```

**Expected**:
- âœ… Checkpoint survives restart
- âœ… Bot loads checkpoint on new message

### Test 5: TTL Expiration

**Goal**: Checkpoints expire after 24 hours

```bash
# Check TTL:
redis-cli
> TTL checkpoint:!room:main:@user:latest
# Should show ~86400 seconds (24 hours)
```

**Expected**:
- âœ… TTL is set
- âœ… ~86400 seconds initially
- âœ… Decreases over time

---

## Verification Commands

### View Checkpoints in Redis

```bash
# List all checkpoints
redis-cli KEYS checkpoint:*

# View specific checkpoint
redis-cli GET checkpoint:!roomid:main:@userid:latest

# Check TTL
redis-cli TTL checkpoint:!roomid:main:@userid:latest

# Count checkpoints
redis-cli KEYS checkpoint:* | wc -l
```

### View Logs

```bash
# Tilt UI: http://localhost:10350
# Click on "verji-vagent-graph" to see logs

# Look for:
# - "Session ID: !room:main:@user"
# - "Room context: 0 messages" (currently)
# - "[request_id] Starting graph execution with session ..."
# - Checkpoint loading/saving messages
```

### Debug Checklist

If conversation memory doesn't work:

1. âœ… Check Redis is running: `redis-cli PING` â†’ PONG
2. âœ… Check checkpoint exists: `redis-cli KEYS checkpoint:*`
3. âœ… Check session_id format: Should be `room:thread:user`
4. âœ… Check graph logs for "Starting graph execution with session"
5. âœ… Verify `messages` field has `add_messages` annotation

## Known Limitations (To Fix in Phase 2)

| Limitation | Impact | Phase 2 Fix |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| **No room context** | Bot doesn't see room discussion | Implement Matrix API fetch |
| **Plaintext checkpoints** | Visible in redis-cli | Add encryption (EncryptedRedisSaver) |
| **No tools** | Bot can only answer questions | Add ToolNode with RBAC |
| **No HITL** | Can't ask for approval | Add HITL node |

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Test Now (Recommended)

1. Run `tilt up`
2. Send messages in Matrix
3. Verify checkpoints in Redis
4. Run all 5 tests above
5. Report findings

### Option 2: Implement Room Context First

1. Research matrix-sdk 0.14 API for message fetching
2. Implement `fetch_room_context()` properly
3. Test room context appears in logs
4. Then test checkpoint memory

### Option 3: Continue to Phase 2 (Encryption)

1. Merge Phase 1 to main
2. Create new branch for Phase 2
3. Implement `EncryptedRedisSaver`
4. Migrate existing checkpoints

---

## Success Criteria

Phase 1 is successful if:

- âœ… Code compiles (Rust: cargo check âœ…, Python: not tested yet)
- âœ… Checkpoints created in Redis
- âœ… Bot remembers conversation across messages
- âœ… Different users have separate checkpoints
- âœ… Conversation survives bot restart
- âœ… TTL is set on checkpoints
- âœ… Room context field exists (even if empty)
