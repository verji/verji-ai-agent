Race condition fix (redis_client.rs):\n   - Subscribe to Redis response channel BEFORE publishing request\n   - Prevents missing progress messages that arrive quickly\n   - Refactor wait_for_final_response to accept pre-subscribed pubsub connection\n   - Add debug logging to trace message flow\n\n2. Async progress callback (verji_agent.rs):\n   - Use tokio channel (mpsc) to bridge sync callback and async Matrix sends\n   - Spawn background task to send progress messages to Matrix room\n   - Each progress update now appears as a separate message in the room\n   - Wait for progress task to complete before returning final response\n\nResult: Users now see real-time progress updates in Matrix:\n- \"🔍 Analyzing your question...\"\n- \"🧠 Thinking about the best response...\"\n- \"✍️ Formulating answer...\"\n- \"[Echo POC with Streaming] You said: ...\"\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")",

      "Bash(git commit -m \"$(cat <<''EOF''\nAdd tool management architecture and consolidated implementation plan\n\nDocuments LangGraph ToolNode decision and provides 4-week implementation roadmap.\n\nTool Management Decision (CONTEXT_AND_ENCRYPTION.md):\n- Use LangGraph ToolNode for automatic tool execution (Option 2)\n- Maintain manual graph control for RBAC, HITL, and progress reporting\n- Clear responsibility matrix: what LangGraph handles vs custom code\n- Complete workflow structure with filter_tools → agent → execute_tools → hitl\n- Credential injection pattern for user-specific tool access\n- Integration with dual context system and encrypted checkpoints\n\nKey Benefits:\n- ToolNode automatically parses tool_calls and creates ToolMessages\n- No manual tool execution code needed\n- Parallel tool execution built-in\n- Full control over RBAC filtering before LLM sees tools\n- HITL approval workflow with checkpoint-based resumption\n\nImplementation Plan (NEW: IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md):\n- 4-week timeline with daily task breakdown\n- Phase 1 (Week 1): Encryption infrastructure + room context fetching\n- Phase 2 (Week 2): LangGraph tool management with ToolNode\n- Phase 3 (Week 3): Multi-turn conversations + HITL workflow\n- Phase 4 (Week 4): Testing, documentation, production readiness\n\nDeliverables:\n- EncryptedRedisSaver with ChaCha20-Poly1305\n- Room context fetching from Matrix API\n- RBAC-filtered tool execution\n- Human-in-the-loop approval for dangerous tools\n- 24-hour encrypted conversation memory\n\nSuccess Criteria:\n- All checkpoints encrypted at rest in Redis\n- Bot sees room context AND personal conversation history\n- LLM only sees tools user has permission to use\n- <500ms total latency (excluding LLM)\n- >90% code coverage with comprehensive tests\n\nRisk Mitigation:\n- Security: Master key in vault, Redis TLS, per-session encryption\n- Performance: Benchmark encryption overhead, limit checkpoint size\n- Operations: Key rotation procedures, disk monitoring\n\nArchitecture Summary:\n1. Rust bot fetches room context (Matrix) + gets AcContext (RBAC provider)\n2. Python graph filters tools based on permissions\n3. LLM reasons with filtered tools + room context + checkpoint history\n4. ToolNode automatically executes approved tools\n5. Checkpoint saved (encrypted) after each node\n6. HITL pauses workflow, resumes after user approval\n\nThis plan consolidates all previous discussions (dual context, encryption,\ntool management) into a single coherent implementation roadmap.\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")",
