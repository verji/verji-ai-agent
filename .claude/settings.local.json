      "Bash(git commit -m \"$(cat <<''EOF''\nFix streaming notifications to display in Matrix rooms\n\nFixes two critical issues preventing progress messages from appearing:\n\n1. Race condition fix (redis_client.rs):\n   - Subscribe to Redis response channel BEFORE publishing request\n   - Prevents missing progress messages that arrive quickly\n   - Refactor wait_for_final_response to accept pre-subscribed pubsub connection\n   - Add debug logging to trace message flow\n\n2. Async progress callback (verji_agent.rs):\n   - Use tokio channel (mpsc) to bridge sync callback and async Matrix sends\n   - Spawn background task to send progress messages to Matrix room\n   - Each progress update now appears as a separate message in the room\n   - Wait for progress task to complete before returning final response\n\nResult: Users now see real-time progress updates in Matrix:\n- \"🔍 Analyzing your question...\"\n- \"🧠 Thinking about the best response...\"\n- \"✍️ Formulating answer...\"\n- \"[Echo POC with Streaming] You said: ...\"\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")",

      "Bash(git commit -m \"$(cat <<''EOF''\nAdd comprehensive conversation context and encryption architecture\n\nDocuments dual context system and encryption design for conversation state.\n\nKey features documented:\n\nArchitecture:\n- Dual context system: room context (ephemeral) + conversation history (persistent)\n- Single encryption layer in Python/LangGraph (simplified from dual-layer design)\n- Session ID format: {room_id}:{thread_id}:{user_id}\n\nRoom Context (Ephemeral):\n- Fetched fresh from Matrix room on each query (last N messages, all users)\n- Provides situational awareness (what''s being discussed)\n- NOT encrypted at rest (fetched on-demand from Matrix)\n- Passed separately to LangGraph alongside user query\n\nConversation History (Persistent, Encrypted):\n- Stored in LangGraph checkpoints with encryption at rest\n- Contains past interactions between specific user and bot\n- Enables multi-turn reasoning, follow-ups, HITL resumption\n- Separate from room context for flexible LLM prompt construction\n\nEncryption Design:\n- ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption)\n- PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 key derivation (100K iterations)\n- Per-session key isolation using session_id as salt\n- Protects conversation history and agent state in Redis\n- Room context remains ephemeral (not encrypted at rest)\n\nImplementation Details:\n- Complete code examples for EncryptedRedisSaver class\n- Rust bot room context fetching with Matrix SDK\n- Python LangGraph agent with dual context support\n- Key management and configuration procedures\n\nSecurity Analysis:\n- Threat model: what''s protected vs what''s not\n- Compliance considerations (GDPR, SOC 2, HIPAA)\n- Defense in depth: encryption at rest + Matrix E2EE\n- Key rotation and recovery procedures\n\nDocumentation includes:\n- Data flow diagrams (Matrix → Bot → Graph → Encrypted Storage)\n- 4-week implementation timeline\n- Testing strategy for encryption correctness\n- Configuration examples with .env templates\n\nThis design eliminates the dual encryption layer complexity while ensuring\nconversation history is encrypted at rest in Redis checkpoints.\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")",
