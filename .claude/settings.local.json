Race condition fix (redis_client.rs):\n   - Subscribe to Redis response channel BEFORE publishing request\n   - Prevents missing progress messages that arrive quickly\n   - Refactor wait_for_final_response to accept pre-subscribed pubsub connection\n   - Add debug logging to trace message flow\n\n2. Async progress callback (verji_agent.rs):\n   - Use tokio channel (mpsc) to bridge sync callback and async Matrix sends\n   - Spawn background task to send progress messages to Matrix room\n   - Each progress update now appears as a separate message in the room\n   - Wait for progress task to complete before returning final response\n\nResult: Users now see real-time progress updates in Matrix:\n- \"🔍 Analyzing your question...\"\n- \"🧠 Thinking about the best response...\"\n- \"✍️ Formulating answer...\"\n- \"[Echo POC with Streaming] You said: ...\"\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")",
